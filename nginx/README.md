# Nginx

### HTTPS and Redirection
Those locations are in described in `nginx/conf/nginx.conf`

### Certificate
The process to create the certificate only included 2 commands which are stored in `nginx/generate-cert.sh` and can be executed using
```bash
sh generate-cert.sh
```
in this folder
After that i needed to make sure that the certificate generated by that command (`nginx/cert/nginx-selfsigned.crt`) was configured as always trust in my computer so HTTPS worked fine

### TSL and Security
The following file `nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf` contains what i think was concerned about security
